## Description

SayText Chat is a simple self-hostable retro chat app that revives the feeling of playing oldschool CS 1.6. It works without logins, hence usernames are related to the clients' session token. If someone claimed a username, it will remain claimed until the last chat message by that user is cleared. To automatically clear message history, use the associated cronjob.

- Send text messages
- Send radio commands
- Send speech commands
- Send leetspeak text
- Switch teams (CT, T, SPEC)
- View online count
